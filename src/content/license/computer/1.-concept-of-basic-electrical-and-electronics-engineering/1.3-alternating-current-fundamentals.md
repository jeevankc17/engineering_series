# 1.3 Alternating Current Fundamentals

### **1. Principle of Alternating Voltage and Current Generation, Equations, and Waveforms**

**Alternating Current (AC)** is an electric current that reverses its direction periodically, as opposed to direct current (DC), where the flow of electric charge is in one direction only.

* **Generation of AC**: AC is typically generated using **alternators** or **synchronous generators**, where mechanical energy (e.g., from a turbine) is converted into electrical energy. The most common method of generation is through electromagnetic induction, where a conductor moves through a magnetic field.
* **AC Waveforms**: The most basic waveform for AC is a **sine wave**, which represents a smooth, periodic oscillation. A typical AC waveform is defined by the following parameters:
  * **Peak Value (Maximum Value)**: The highest value of the waveform (voltage or current).
  * **RMS (Root Mean Square) Value**: The effective value of the waveform. For a sinusoidal AC, the RMS value is the peak value divided by âˆš2.
  * **Average Value**: The average of all instantaneous values in one complete cycle, often zero for symmetric sinusoidal waveforms.
*   **Equation for a sinusoidal AC waveform**:

    * $$v(t) = V_{\text{max}} \sin(\omega t + \phi)$$

    Where:

    * $$v(t) = \text{instantaneous voltage}$$
    * $$V_{\text{max}} = \text{peak voltage}$$
    * $$\omega = \text{angular frequency} \quad (\omega = 2\pi f, \text{ where } f \text{ is the frequency})$$
    * $$t = \text{time}$$
    * $$\phi = \text{phase angle}$$

### **2. Average, Peak, and RMS Values**

1. **Peak Value**:

The **peak value** (also known as the **maximum value**) is the highest point reached by the voltage or current in one cycle. For a sinusoidal AC, the peak value is denoted as $$( V_{\text{peak}} )$$or $$( I_{\text{peak}} )$$.

2. **RMS (Root Mean Square) Value**:

The RMS value is a measure of the effective value of an AC waveform. It is the equivalent DC value that would produce the same power dissipation in a resistive load.

* For a sinusoidal waveform:
  * $$V_{\text{RMS}} = \frac{V_{\text{peak}}}{\sqrt{2}}$$

This means that the RMS value is approximately 0.707 times the peak value for a sinusoidal waveform.

3. **Average Value**:

The **average value** is the arithmetic mean of the values of the waveform over one complete cycle. For a pure sinusoidal waveform, the average value is zero (due to the symmetrical nature of the waveform). However, the **average absolute value** (or the rectified average value) is often used:

* $$V_{\text{avg}} = \frac{2}{\pi} V_{\text{peak}} \approx 0.637 \times V_{\text{peak}}$$

For half-wave rectified signals, the average value is non-zero.

### **3. Three-Phase Systems**

In a three-phase electrical system, the equations describe the relationship between voltage, current, and power. Three-phase systems are commonly used in power generation, transmission, and distribution because they provide a more efficient means of delivering electrical energy. Below are the key equations for a three-phase system.

1. **Voltage Equations in a Three-Phase System**

In a balanced three-phase system, the voltages of the three phases are sinusoidal, with each phase 120 degrees apart from the others. For a line-to-line voltage $$V_{LL}$$ and line-to-neutral voltage $$V_{LN}$$, the equations are:

* **Line-to-line voltage** $$V_{LL}$$: The relationship between the phase voltage $$V_{\text{ph}}$$ (line-to-neutral) and the line-to-line voltage is:
  * $$V_{LL} = \sqrt{3} \times V_{LN}$$
*   **Line-to-neutral voltage** $$V_{LN}$$: Each phase voltage is represented as a sinusoidal function:

    * $$V_{\text{ph}}(t) = V_{LN} \sin(\omega t + \phi)$$

    Where:

    * $$\omega$$ is the angular frequency
    * $$\phi$$ is the phase angle

2. **Current Equations in a Three-Phase System**

The current in a balanced three-phase system can be described in a similar manner to voltage. The line current $$I_L$$ and phase current $$I_{\text{ph}}$$ are related by:

*   **Phase current** $$I_{\text{ph}}$$: The current in each phase is sinusoidal and related to the line-to-neutral voltage:

    * $$I_{\text{ph}}(t) = \frac{V_{\text{ph}}(t)}{Z}$$

    Where $$Z$$ is the impedance of the load (which could be a resistor, inductor, or a combination).
* **Line current** $$I_L$$: In a balanced load, the line current is equal to the phase current:
  * $$I_L = I_{\text{ph}}$$

***

3. **Power Equations in a Three-Phase System**

Power in a three-phase system is calculated using the following key formulas:

*   **Apparent Power** $$S$$: The total apparent power in a balanced three-phase system is:

    * $$S = \sqrt{3} \times V_{LL} \times I_L$$

    Where:

    * $$V_{LL}$$ is the line-to-line voltage
    * $$I_L$$ is the line current
*   **Real Power** $$P$$: The real power (active power) in the system is:

    * $$P = \sqrt{3} \times V_{LL} \times I_L \times \cos(\phi)$$

    Where:

    * $$\phi$$ is the phase angle between the voltage and current
* **Reactive Power** $$Q$$: The reactive power (which does not perform work but is needed to maintain the electric and magnetic fields) is:
  * $$Q = \sqrt{3} \times V_{LL} \times I_L \times \sin(\phi)$$

***

* Voltages in a balanced three-phase system are 120 degrees apart.
* Currents in a balanced system are proportional to the voltages and impedances in the load.
* Power is more efficiently transmitted using three-phase systems because the power delivery is continuous and steady, avoiding the pulsations that occur in single-phase systems.

These equations form the basis for understanding the operation and performance of three-phase systems in both power generation and distribution.

### Conclusion

* AC is an electrical current that reverses direction periodically, generated through electromagnetic induction.
* Key AC parameters: peak value, RMS value (effective value), and average value.
* Three-phase systems provide more constant and efficient power, requiring less conductor material compared to single-phase systems.
